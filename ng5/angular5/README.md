## How to create angular project with custom version 
1) Create a folder called ng5 to house all of your new Angular 5 applications:
md ng5
cd ng5
2) In your ng5 folder create a new local npm application by using:
npm init -y
3) Install Angular 5 CLI locally using:
npm install @angular/cli@1.7.4
4) Now you MUST delete the local package.json file. If you donâ€™t, Angular CLI will complain when you try use ng new. This is because it will think you are trying to create a new application inside an existing Angular CLI application.
5) Create your new Angular 5 application:
ng new my-ng5-app
